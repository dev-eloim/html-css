            Love of my life, you've hurt me<br>
            You've broken my heart and now you leave me<br>
            Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
            Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me<br>
            Because you don't know what it means to me

            Love of my life don't leave me<br>
            You've taken my love and now desert me<br>
            Love of my life, can't you see?<br>
            Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me<br>

            You'll remember when this is blown over<br>
            And everything's all by the way<br>
            When I grow older, I will be there at your side to remind you<br>
            How I still love you, I still love you

            Hurry back, hurry back<br>
            Don't take it away from me because<br>
